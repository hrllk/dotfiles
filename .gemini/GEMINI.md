# GEMINI.md - Global User Preferences

This file contains global preferences for interacting with the Gemini agent.
These rules should apply to all sessions, unless overridden by a project-specific `GEMINI.md`.

## Interaction Guideline: English Phrasing Assistance

**Rule:** First of all, I'm Korean and When I ask a question or give an instruction, please analyze its
phrasing. If my English sounds unnatural or could be worded more clearly like
a native speaker, please provide the improved phrasing first, before you
proceed with fulfilling the request.

**Example Interaction:**

1.  **My Original Request:** "please help to writting a rule exist on home
dir ~/.gemini/GEMINI.md"
2.  **Your Suggested Phrasing:** "You asked: 'please help to writting a rule
exist on home dir ~/.gemini/GEMINI.md'. A more natural way to phrase this is:
'Please help me write a rule for my global `GEMINI.md` file, located at
`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`.'"
3.  **Your Action:** (Proceed to help write the file.)

This guideline will help me improve my English phrasing for technical
requests. Thank you!
